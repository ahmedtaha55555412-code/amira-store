Task ID: 1
Agent: Z.ai Code (main)
Task: Retrieve, inspect, and verify the official Amira Store Greenfield planning repository. NO implementation.

Work Log:
- Cloned https://github.com/ahmedtaha55555412-code/amira-store-plan.git into /home/z/amira-store-plan
- Verified remote URL, branch `main` (only branch), HEAD commit `2f4e4b31927b9caa28f32c0ac7c26f0a537dfbf8`, clean working tree
- Inventoried 36 tracked files; verified no untracked/ignored files
- Read completely ALL 8 top-level control files: AGENTS.md, MASTER_PLAN.md, EXECUTION_STATUS.md, ACCESS_MATRIX.md, ZAI_BOOTSTRAP.md, ZAI_GREENFIELD_BOOTSTRAP.md, README.md, RESEARCH_NOTES.md
- Read completely docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md and docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- Read completely all 7 docs/ops files: COMPLETION_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md, DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md, ERROR_PROTOCOL.md, ISSUE_LOG.md, PHASE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md, PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, SEED_PLAN.md
- Read completely all 16 docs/phases files: PHASE-00.md through PHASE-15.md
- Read completely all 3 docs/qa files: FINAL_ACCEPTANCE.md, TEST_CASES.md, TRACEABILITY.md

Stage Summary:
- EXECUTION_STATE = PLAN_VERIFIED_WAITING_FOR_START
- Plan is complete and fully readable: 15 gated phases (PHASE_00..PHASE_15), greenfield bootstrap contract, execution status = NOT_STARTED / CURRENT_PHASE = PHASE_00
- Stack declared by plan: Next.js App Router + TS strict, PostgreSQL/Neon + Drizzle ORM (migration-file driven), Vercel + Vercel Blob, GitHub CI, Arabic-only RTL, Egypt/EGP, COD only, single admin (username+password), WhatsApp handoff (+201019003677 default), variant-level pricing/stock/SKU/images
- No implementation performed. No GitHub/Neon/Vercel resources created or modified. Planning repository untouched (clone only). Phase 00 NOT started.
- Awaiting explicit owner instruction to start.

Task ID: 2
Agent: Z.ai Code (main)
Task: Execute PHASE-00 — Greenfield Bootstrap + Execution Controls (Amira Store)

Work Log:
- Re-read docs/phases/PHASE-00.md; confirmed DoD, outputs, integration checks
- Verified tooling: Node v24.21.0, Bun 1.3.14, Git 2.47.3; gh/vercel/neonctl NOT installed, no token auth → B-001/B-002/B-003 blockers recorded (not faked)
- Confirmed greenfield: no legacy Amira Store code; sandbox Next.js 16 + TS + Tailwind 4 scaffold used as base (documented adaptation, ISSUE-004)
- Imported all 36 planning files into app repo (root controls + docs/{phases,ops,qa})
- Created .env.example (names only); added !.env.example gitignore exception
- Replaced scaffold page with Arabic RTL baseline placeholder; removed scaffold branding/metadata
- Added typecheck script; created .github/workflows/ci.yml (install/typecheck/lint/build)
- Validation: bun install clean; lint exit 0; typecheck exit 0 after excluding sandbox examples/skills from TS program (ISSUE-005); dev server 200 on /, lang=ar dir=rtl, no log errors
- Pre-commit review found scaffold-era tracked .env + db/custom.db → untracked via git rm --cached, added db/*.db ignore (ISSUE-006); staged-diff secret scan clean
- Baseline commit c82c9d9 on main; push BLOCKED (no GitHub auth)
- Updated EXECUTION_STATUS.md (PHASE_00 local PASS / provisioning BLOCKED), ISSUE_LOG (001-006), BASELINE.md
- TRACEABILITY: no product requirement rows implemented in Phase 00 → all rows intentionally remain PENDING (per AGENTS.md: update only for implemented requirements)

Stage Summary:
- Phase: PHASE_00 | Status: BLOCKED (phase gate) — local scope PASS; external provisioning pending owner authorization (GitHub B-001, Vercel B-002, Neon B-003)
- CURRENT_PHASE remains PHASE_00; PROJECT_STATUS=BLOCKED (documented, explained)
- Commit: c82c9d9 "chore(phase-00): greenfield baseline — execution controls, env contract, CI scaffold"
- Exact authorization steps for owner recorded in docs/ops/BASELINE.md §8

Task ID: 3
Agent: Z.ai Code (main)
Task: Single-shot GitHub device-flow authorization (owner-paced; no background polling)

Work Log:
- Per owner instruction: abandoned gh CLI device flow / background polling; switched to one-shot owner-paced protocol
- Confirmed no GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN env leakage into shell environment
- Single foreground POST to https://github.com/login/device/code (client_id = GitHub CLI official OAuth app 178c6fc778ccc68e1d6a; scopes: repo, workflow, read:org — read:org included to fix the earlier gh token-validation rejection)
- HTTP 200; device_code persisted internally at /home/z/.cache/amira-store/gh-device-flow.json (chmod 600); device_code value NOT displayed or logged
- user_code + verification_uri shown to owner in chat; owner authorizes in browser at own pace
- NO polling process started; NO further codes will be generated while owner authorizes; exactly ONE token-status check will run after owner sends "done"

Stage Summary:
- Waiting on owner browser authorization (code expires in ~15 minutes)
- Constraints in force: no amira-store repo creation, no amira-store-plan modification, no Vercel/Neon auth, PHASE_00 remains BLOCKED until GitHub auth is verified; access token must never be displayed or logged

Task ID: 3-completion
Agent: Z.ai Code (main)
Task: Complete single-shot GitHub device-flow authorization after owner sent "done"

Work Log:
- Owner authorized device code in browser; sent "done"
- Performed EXACTLY ONE token-status check (foreground POST to GitHub OAuth token endpoint) → success: bearer token granted, scopes `read:org, repo, workflow` (exactly the set gh requires; fixes earlier gh validation rejection)
- Registered credential into gh via `gh auth login --with-token` (token passed through stdin pipe only)
- Shredded/removed ALL temp credential files (gh-token.txt, gh-token.json, gh-device-flow.json); token value never printed, piped to stdout, or logged anywhere
- `gh auth status` → ✓ Logged in to github.com account `ahmedtaha55555412-code` (active), scopes 'read:org', 'repo', 'workflow'
- Verified authenticated login = `ahmedtaha55555412-code` via `gh api user`
- Verified access to https://github.com/ahmedtaha55555412-code via `gh api users/ahmedtaha55555412-code` (login + type + html_url match)
- Verified read access to owner's plan repo via `gh repo view ahmedtaha55555412-code/amira-store-plan` (read-only; plan repo NOT modified)
- Updated EXECUTION_STATUS.md: PHASE_00 addendum — B-001 authentication half CLEARED; PROJECT_STATUS stays BLOCKED (repo creation, Vercel B-002, Neon B-003 still pending owner go-ahead)

Stage Summary:
- GitHub authentication VERIFIED for ahmedtaha55555412-code (B-001 auth portion resolved)
- Honored all constraints: no amira-store repo created, amira-store-plan untouched, Vercel/Neon NOT started, no polling, token never displayed/logged
- PHASE_00 remains BLOCKED until: amira-store repo creation + push (B-001 closure), Vercel provisioning (B-002), Neon provisioning (B-003) — all awaiting explicit owner instruction
